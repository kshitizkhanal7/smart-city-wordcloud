    The UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) considers smart cities a process rather than a static outcome, 
    in which increased citizen engagement, hard infrastructure, social capital and digital technologies make cities more liveable, 
    resilient and better able to respond to challenges.66
    
    
    The British Standards Institute (BSI) defines the term as “the effective integration of physical, digital and human systems in the
    built environment to deliver sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its citizens”.67


    IBM defines a smart city as “one that makes optimal use of all the interconnected information available today to better understand
    and control its operations and optimize the use of limited resources”.68
    
    
    Cisco defines smart cities as those who adopt “scalable solutions that take advantage of information and communications technology (ICT)
    to increase efficiencies, reduce costs, and enhance quality of life”.69


Citizen-focused definitions

    UK citizens tend to consider a smart city as clean, friendly and has good transport connections. Other words they associate with smart
    cities (although less frequently) include “technology”, “connected”, “internet” and “modern”.70


    According to the Manchester Digital Development agency, “a ‘smart city’ means ‘smart citizens’ – where citizens have all
    the information they need to make informed choices about their lifestyle, work and travel options”.71
